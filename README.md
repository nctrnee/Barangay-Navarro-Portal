# Barangay Navarro Portal

A web portal for Barangay Navarro (General Trias) that enables residents to view announcements, request official documents, contact barangay staff, and register/log in for online services.

## Features
- Community announcements (expandable details)  
- Online document request form (certificate, clearance, indigency)  
- Contact form with email/phone details  
- User registration and login (frontend demo; backend required for persistence)  
- Responsive, accessible, and framework-free (HTML/CSS/vanilla JS)

## Technologies
- HTML  
- CSS 
- JavaScript
  
## Notes
- Current registration/login and data flows are front-end only. Implement a backend and secure storage (bcrypt/argon2 + HTTPS) for production.
- Consider splitting CSS/JS into separate files and minifying assets before production.
